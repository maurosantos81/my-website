# Personal Website Project

This repository contains the source code for my **personal website**, showcasing some of my information, skills, projects and a way to contact me.

## Interesting features

**Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

**SEO:** With Next.js, the website is optimized for search engines, ensuring better visibility and ranking on search engine result pages (SERPs).

**Animations:** The website incorporates animations to enhance user engagement and create visually appealing interactions. Animations can be used for page transitions, scrolling effects, hover effects, and more.

**Internationalization:** The website supports two languages, Portuguese and English, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Technology Used

I've chosen **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** for my project primarily because of its SEO benefits and simplified development process. With Next.js, I can ensure better search engine optimization (SEO) for my website than with React alone, by utilizing its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. This allows search engines to crawl and index my pages more effectively, leading to improved visibility and higher rankings on search engine result pages. Additionally, tasks such as routing and code splitting are simplified, enabling me to focus more on building features.

## Libraries Used

**[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/):**
I've used React Hook Form library for the form in the "Hire Me" section, streamlining the management of form inputs, validation rules, and submission logic.

**[Material-UI](https://mui.com/):** I've used the Material-UI library to enhance the user interface of my project through a collection of pre-designed components and styles based on Google's Material Design principles. This choice simplified the design process leading to a faster development.

**[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/):** I've used the Framer Motion to incorporate animations into my project, such as for animating the title and percentage of each skill in skills section.

**[React Email](https://react.email/) and [Resend](https://resend.com/):** I've used the React Email and Resend libraries to handle the submission of contact forms in the "Hire Me" section of my project.

**[Next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/):** I've used Next-intl to enhance internationalization support, thus promoting greater accessibility and user-friendliness for the users.

## Fonts Used

I've opted to use the fonts [Staatliches](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches) for titles and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?) for the rest of the text.
